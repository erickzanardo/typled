# Typled

Typled is a text based map tool. It uses a simple format where characters are mapped to a texture
and then the "position" of the character in the text is used to determine the position of the
texture in the map.

For example, lets say we have `G` mapped to grass tile and W mapped to water tile. So for example:

```
GWG
GWG
GWG
```

Define a 3x3 map with a river on the middle and grass on the sides.
